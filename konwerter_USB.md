# Konwerter_USB

## Overview
Industrial controller PCB designed for monitoring and control applications.

## My Role
- Full schematic and PCB design
- Power supply architecture
- Hardware bring-up and testing

## Key Components
- MCU: STM32F407
- Power: 24V → 5V → 3.3V (buck + LDO)
- Interfaces: RS485, CAN, GPIO

## Challenges
- Noise immunity in industrial environment
- Proper grounding and EMI reduction
- Thermal management

## Results
- Stable operation in noisy environment
- Successfully deployed in prototypes
